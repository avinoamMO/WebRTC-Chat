## Feature Description

A clear description of what you'd like to see added.

## Use Case

Why is this feature useful? What problem does it solve?

**Example scenarios:**
- "I want to record calls so I can review meetings later"
- "I need TURN server support so peers behind corporate firewalls can connect"
- "I want file sharing over data channel so I can send documents during a call"

## Proposed Implementation

If you have ideas on how this could work:

- Which Web APIs would be used? (e.g., MediaRecorder, RTCDataChannel, Canvas)
- Does this require changes to the signaling layer (ScaleDrone)?
- Does this require a server-side component?

## Alternatives Considered

Any other approaches you thought about.

## Compatibility Notes

- Which browsers need to support this?
- Does this work on mobile?
- Does this add any external dependencies? (The project is currently zero-dependency.)
